# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-The project was to help keep the inventory of the Corner Grocery store, specifically the produce department, which the store is rearranging.


What did you do particularly well?
-I am proud of the work I did with the ProduceList class. Object oriented programming is a step in the right direction for my development skills.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-The feedback on this project was universally positive and with 100% grade, but I'd welcome some suggestions on improving my code.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-While I said earlier that the part I did best at was the object oriented piece, that was also difficult. My professor was able to set me on the right track, and some online resources like w3schools helped too.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-The two skills that I most enjoyed practicing were the object oriented pieces and the file input and output. I believe I can apply these to further projects, both in C++ and my other languages.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I made sure that there were accessors and mutators in place to make the code expandable. I documented the code with comments. I also included a pseudocode flowchart.
